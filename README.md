For this repository to work it is advised to initialize a python venv: "https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html"
Of course it is implied that you have Python3 installed on your device

in this venv or on your whole device you need to install the following packages:
-django (pip install django)


everytime working with the Django app you need to activate the virtual environment:
.\env\Scripts\activate
you can deactivate it by using deactivate
